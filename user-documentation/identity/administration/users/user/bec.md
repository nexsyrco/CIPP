# Compromise Remediation

Upon page load, CIPP will run an analysis on the user to identify common Indicators of Compromise (IoC). Once that analysis is returned, review the information presented and determine if the user has been compromised. The analysis performs the checks listed in the table below. A green check will indicate that information was found for the check and needs review.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: This page is intended to surface information about potential information that should be reviewed when a compromise is suspected. The existence of information in one of the indicators should not be interpreted as an absolute sign of compromise but rather as a useful tool to help quickly surface the basic information that should be reviewed during your investigation.

| Mailbox Rules              | Inbox rules currently on the mailbox, plus any rule create/change/remove operations in the last 7 days. Flags a potential breach when a rule moves mail to an `RSS`-type folder, and highlights rules created or changed within the last 7 days. |
| Recently Added Users       | Users created in the tenant within the last 14 days.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Sent Messages              | Messages sent from the mailbox within the analysis window — subject, recipient, status, received time and source IP — for spotting suspicious outbound activity.                                                                                 |
| MFA Devices                | Authentication / MFA methods registered on the account (method type, display name, registration date).                                                                                                                                           |
| Password Changes           | Most recent password-change timestamps across the tenant's users.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Trusted & Blocked Senders  | The mailbox's trusted and blocked sender/domain safelist, plus any changes to that list in the last 7 days.                                                                                                                                      |
