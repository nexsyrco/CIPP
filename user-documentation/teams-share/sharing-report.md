| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Name               | Name of the shared file or item the sharing link points to.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Item Type               | The kind of item shared (for example a file or a folder).                                                                                                                                                   |
| Workload                | The service the item lives in: `SharePoint` or `OneDrive`. Also used by the table's quick filters.                                                                                                          |
| Site Name               | The SharePoint site (or OneDrive account) hosting the item.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Classification          | Risk classification of the link's audience, derived from the link scope: `Anonymous` (red), `External` (amber), or `Internal` (green). Drives the color coding and the Anonymous/External/Internal filters. |
| Link Type               | The kind of sharing link, mapped from the Graph `sharingLink` type facet — e.g. `view` (read-only), `edit` (read-write), or `embed`. Falls back to `link` when the type is unknown.                         |
| Roles                   | The permission role(s) the link grants (for example `read`, `write`, or `owner`). Rendered as a comma-joined list when multiple roles apply.                                                                |
| Shared With             | The recipients the item is shared with (list of identities). Typically empty for open anonymous links, which aren't scoped to specific people.                                                              |
| Expiration Date Time    | When the sharing link is set to expire. Shows `Never` in the row detail when no expiry is configured.                                                                                                       |
| Last Modified Date Time | When the sharing link or permission was last modified.                                                                                                                                                      |
