| Tenant        | The tenant the search window belongs to, shown as its default domain name (the ledger's partition key).                                                                                                    |
| Type          | The kind of ledger entry: `Window` (a normal planned 60-minute search window), `Reconciliation` (a `RECON-*` gap-fill block), or `Manual` (a `MANUAL-*` manually queued search bridged into the pipeline). |
| Window Start  | Start of the search window, in UTC.                                                                                                                                                                        |

| State         | Where the window sits in the V2 pipeline: `Planned`, `Created`, `Downloaded`, `Retry`, `DeadLetter` (failed permanently), or `Skipped` (unified auditing off for the tenant).                              |
| Search Status | The underlying Graph audit-log search status (e.g. `notStarted`, `running`, `succeeded`), refreshed on each poll.                                                                                          |
| Record Count  | Number of audit records the window's Graph search returned and downloaded.                                                                                                                                 |

| Last Error    | The most recent error recorded for the window, if any (blank when healthy).                                                                                                                                |
